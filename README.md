This repository provides IoT dongle platform over Wi-Fi.

## What is IoT dongle?
IoT dongle enables device to connect the Internet and get the Internet service.

## Why is IoT dongle?
In general, home appliances have long life-cycle, more than 10 years. Then, which air-conditioner do you want to buy? One is not connected to the Internet and you cannot get the innovated service for more than 10 years. The other is connected to the Internet and you need to pay more money. As of now, there is no killer app to force you to buy the Internet connected device.

IoT dongle is another approach. Now, you buy the IoT dongle ready device. Later, you may buy the IoT dongle to enable you to get the valuable service from the Internet, separately.

## Configuration
![Alt text](/IoT_dongle_device.jpg?raw=true "Simple configuration using ARDUINO and ESP8266")

This is one simple configuration - IoT dongle ready device on ARDUINO and IoT dongle on ESP8266. The following projects explain how to build them.
* https://github.com/gaiakeeper/device_arduino
* https://github.com/gaiakeeper/dongle_esp8266

And there are simulated device and dongle on Windows in the following projects.
* https://github.com/gaiakeeper/device_windows
* https://github.com/gaiakeeper/dongle_windows

This IoT dongle platform is common for all dongles.
